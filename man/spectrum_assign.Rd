\title{Match peptide predicted fragments with a spectrum.}
\usage{
spectrum_assign(spectrum = NULL, peptide = NULL, tolerance = 0.1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{spectrum}{A spectrum data object.}

\item{peptide}{The character string representing a peptide, or poly amino acid. The canonical
20 amino acids are encoded in and chemical modifications can be represented by
and floating point numerical value enclosed by square brackets. If a canonical
amino acid is also enclosed in the square brackets \verb{[M15.99]} it is assumed that
the numerical value is in addition to the mass of the residue, and thus represents
a post-translational modification (PTM).}

\item{tolerance}{The tolerance in Th to allow predicted fragments to match observed values.}

\item{...}{Flow-through parameters to \code{fragments()}}
}
\description{
\code{assign_spectrum()} assigns the predicted fragment masses of a given peptide
sequence with the mass spectrum.
